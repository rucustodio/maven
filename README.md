# Maven - Rate your lunch

# Overview
To design and develop a working web app that allows users the ability to rate their lunches from different establishments. This will improve their lunch-buying decisions by getting real user feedback, key nutritional information, and price. In turn, this will save users money, time, and bad lunch experiences. 

# Specifications

Users will have the ability to either create a brand new product and to write a custom review on any verified product, that is all. It will be built using Ruby on Rails back-end with Postgres DB. The front end will consist of HTML5, SCSS, React and ES6.
